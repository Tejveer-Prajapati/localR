✅ 1. Prerequisites Before Learning Kafka
You do NOT need to be an expert, but you should know the following basics:
✔ 1. Core Java (Intermediate level)
You should understand:


OOP concepts


Threads & concurrency basics


Serialization


Collections


Exceptions


Kafka clients are often used in Java/Spring Boot projects.

✔ 2. Spring Boot Basics (Optional but Helpful)
Kafka integrates heavily with Spring Boot.
You should know:


REST API


Configurations


Dependency injection



✔ 3. Linux & Command Line Basics
Kafka runs on Linux servers, so understand:


cd, ls, vim


Starting background processes


Exporting environment variables



✔ 4. Basic Networking Concepts
Kafka is a distributed system. Know:


Ports


DNS/Hosts


Brokers (servers)


Clusters



✔ 5. Zookeeper (Old) or KRaft (New)


Old Kafka uses Zookeeper.


New Kafka versions use KRaft (built-in).


Just have awareness; not deep knowledge needed initially.

🚀 2. Roadmap to Learn Apache Kafka (Beginner → Advanced)

🌱 Stage 1: Kafka Basics
Start with essential core concepts:
🎯 Learn:


What is Kafka?


Use cases (real-time processing, messaging, event streaming)


What is a broker?


What is a cluster?


What is a topic?


What is a partition?


What is replication?


Producers vs Consumers


Consumer Groups


Offsets


Log-based storage


📘 Goal: Understand how Kafka moves data.

🌱 Stage 2: Install & Run Kafka
Practice is essential.
Install Kafka locally using:
✔ Zookeeper version
OR
✔ KRaft version (recommended)
Learn commands:


Create topic


List topics


Produce messages


Consume messages


Describe cluster


📘 Goal: Send and receive messages using CLI.

🌱 Stage 3: Kafka Producers & Consumers (Java/Spring Boot)
🎯 Learn:


Producer API (Java)


Consumer API (Java)


Serialization/Deserialization


StringSerializer


JsonSerializer


AvroSerializer




Keys & Partitions


Consumer groups & rebalance


Error handling


Retrying mechanisms


Write code:


Spring Boot Kafka Producer


Spring Boot Kafka Consumer


📘 Goal: Build a simple working application.

🌱 Stage 4: Schema Management (Important for real projects)
Learn:
✔ Apache Avro (most used)


Schema registry (Confluent)


Compatible schema evolution


Or use:


Protobuf


JSON schema registry


📘 Goal: Learn how Kafka enforces data contracts.

🌱 Stage 5: Kafka Streams (Optional but in demand)
Kafka Streams = real-time processing library.
Learn:


KStream


KTable


Join / Map / Filter


Windowing


Stateful processors


📘 Goal: Build a simple streaming pipeline.

🌱 Stage 6: Kafka Connect (Must Know!)
Kafka Connect allows integrating Kafka with external systems without writing code.
🎯 Learn:


What is Connect distributed mode


Source connectors (read from DB → Kafka)


Sink connectors (Kafka → DB, ES, S3)


Tasks, workers


Connector configuration


REST API for connectors


Practice with popular connectors:
✔ JDBC Connector (Database ↔ Kafka)
✔ Debezium Connector (CDC: Change Data Capture)
✔ Elasticsearch Connector
✔ S3 Connector
📘 Goal: Move data into/out of Kafka using connectors.

🌱 Stage 7: Kafka Cluster Administration
Learn how Kafka works in production:
🎯 Learn:


Multi-broker cluster setup


Replication factor


Broker configurations


Partition rebalancing


Log retention & cleanup


Monitoring & alerts


Use tools:


Prometheus


Grafana


Kafka Manager


Burrow


📘 Goal: Understand real-world cluster management.

🌱 Stage 8: Kafka Security
Learn:


SSL


SASL


Kerberos


ACLs


Authentication


Authorization


📘 Goal: Secure Kafka like production systems.

🌱 Stage 9: Cloud Kafka (Optional but Useful)
Learn cloud offerings:


Confluent Cloud


AWS MSK


Azure Event Hub (Kafka API)


📘 Goal: Deploy Kafka in the cloud.
